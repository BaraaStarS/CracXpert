# Disclaimer
CrackXpert is my first project in the realm of automated password cracking, and while I have strived to ensure its functionality, it is important to acknowledge that the tool may not deliver 100% accuracy in all scenarios.

This tool is a work in progress, and I am committed to continuously developing and improving it. I greatly appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or bug reports from the community. Your input is invaluable in helping me enhance CrackXpert to better meet the needs of users.

Thank you for your understanding and support as I work to make CrackXpert a reliable and robust tool for the cybersecurity community.
